# hello-world

My name is Duendar and I am a complete noob if it comes to programming.

However, I understood, that my current job is not going to be the one I want to do until I die - not to mention that it's going to be automated anyway at some point in the future.

Hence I decided to learn programming.

So I already heard about Github, however, I never knew what it was about.

Now, that I do - this must be programmer's heaven compared to how it was used to be done before Github existed.

I am amazed about this new world, and I'm sure, that I will soon be a respectable part of it.

Kind greetings,

Duendar
